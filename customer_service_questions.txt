q: face covers
a: People older than 2 can wear face masks in public where it's hard to maintain social distance. They're not substitutes for medical masks or other health recommendations. Those under 2, or those who have trouble breathing, should not wear them. They don't protect the wearer but can prevent spread. Non-medical covers reduce face touching and possible transmission. Removing them requires precautions like not touching the face and washing hands after. For more details, check WHO and CDC guidelines on mask usage. Before wearing, clean your hands, ensure the cover fits well but allows breathing. Don't use if it's wet, dirty, or damaged. Always wash before reuse and ensure children under 2 don't wear them.

q: How should I wash and care for my Happy Socks?
a: We are advocates for protecting our planet, and a step towards that is taking good care of what we own, including our socks. At Happy Socks, we strive to ensure our socks are of top-notch quality. However, the longevity might differ based on how you care for and handle them. For varieties like regular, sneaker, dressed, and kids socks, the advised washing temperature is 40°C/104°F.
